# MedCare Online Pharmacy - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the MedCare Online Pharmacy application.

**Deployed Application:** [https://medcareorg.netlify.app/](https://medcareorg.netlify.app/)

## Technologies Used

This project is built with:

-   Vite
-   TypeScript
-   React
-   shadcn-ui
-   Tailwind CSS

## Local Development Setup

To set up and run this project locally, please follow these steps. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed (using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) is recommended).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_GIT_URL>
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_REPOSITORY_GIT_URL>` with the actual Git URL of this repository.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd <YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>
    ```
    Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME>` with the name of the cloned directory.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the development server with auto-reloading and provide a local URL for previewing the application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port displayed in your terminal).

## Editing the Code

You can edit the application's code using your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) after cloning the repository. Changes can be committed and pushed to the repository using standard Git commands.

Alternatively, you can edit files directly within GitHub:
-   Navigate to the desired file(s) in the repository.
-   Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
-   Make your changes and commit them directly to the repository.

GitHub Codespaces can also be used for a cloud-based development environment:
-   Navigate to the main page of this repository.
-   Click on the "Code" button (usually green).
-   Select the "Codespaces" tab.
-   Click on "Create codespace on main" (or your current branch) to launch a new Codespace environment.
-   Edit files within the Codespace, then commit and push your changes as you normally would.

## Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, or other static site hosting services that support Vite-React applications. Typically, you would connect your Git repository to the hosting platform and configure the build command (e.g., `npm run build`) and the publish directory (e.g., `dist`).
